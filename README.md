# Defold - PCG Random

PCG Random Number Generator Native Extension for the Defold Game Engine

This extension allow you to generate random numbers using minimal [C implementation of PCG](http://www.pcg-random.org/using-pcg-c-basic.html).

It uses [entropy](https://github.com/imneme/pcg-c/blob/master/extras/entropy.c) seed internally with fallback to time based seed. You can switch to Time based seed and remove the entropy by uncommenting/commenting a few lines on the source code, but I don't think it is necessary. 

## Installation
You can use PCG Random in your own project by adding this project as a [Defold library dependency](http://www.defold.com/manuals/libraries/). Open your game.project file and in the dependencies field under project add:

## Toss a Coin to Your Witcher
If you find my [Defold Extensions](https://github.com/selimanac) useful for your projects, please consider [supporting](https://github.com/sponsors/selimanac) it.  
I'd love to hear about your projects! Please share your released projects that use my native extensions. It would be very motivating for me.



## Usage

### rnd.seed(`init_state`, `init_seq`)

Seeds the random number generator.   
Random number generator is always initialized by using entropy seed. You don't need to call this method unless you want to control the seed.


`init_state` is the starting state for the RNG, you can pass any 64-bit value.  
`init_seq` selects the output sequence for the RNG, you can pass any 64-bit value, although only the low 63 bits are significant.
 
**Caution:** I don't recommend using of 64-bit integers. Consider using 32-bit integers instead. 

### rnd.seed()

Re-seed the random number generator by using entropy seed.  
Random number generator is always initialized by using entropy seed. You donâ€™t need to call this method unless you want to re-seed.

### rnd.number()

Returns a 32 bit unsigned integer.

### rnd.range(`min`, `max`)

Returns a 32 bit unsigned integer between min and max values. Only for positive numbers(unsigned integers).   
Same as **math.random(3,20)**  
**math.random(90)** == rnd.range(1, 90)

### rnd.double()

Returns a floating point between 0-1.  
Same as **math.random()**

### rnd.double_range(`min`, `max`)

Returns a floating point between min - max.  
Not fast as `rnd.double()`

### rnd.dice(`roll`, `type`)

DnD style dice roller.   

**PARAMETERS**

* ```roll``` (int) - Roll amount
* ```type``` (enum) - Type of the dice

	**rnd.d4** : D4: four-sided die.       
	**rnd.d6** : D6: six-sided die.    
	**rnd.d8** : D8: eight-sided die.    
	**rnd.d10** : D10: ten-sided die (0-9).   
	**rnd.d12** : D12: twelve-sided die.    
	**rnd.d20** : D20: twenty-sided die.    
	**rnd.d100** : D%: percentile die (0-90).    
	
**RETURN**

* ```result``` (table) - Dice results
* ```total``` (int) - Total amout of dice results

**EXAMPLE**

```lua

local result, total = rnd.dice(2, rnd.d10)

```


### rnd.toss()

Toss a coin. Returns 0 or 1 (0 = 'H', 1 = 'T')

### rnd.roll()

Roll the dice. Returns between 1-6

### rnd.check()

Testing entropy.
