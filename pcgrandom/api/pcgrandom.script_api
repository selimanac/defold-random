  members:
    - name: seed
      type: function
      desc: Seeds the random number generator.
        Random number generator is always initialized by using entropy seed. You don't need to call this method unless you want to control the seed.
      parameters:
        - name: init_state
          type: number
          desc: init_state is the starting state for the RNG, you can pass any 64-bit value.
        - name: init_seq
          type: number
          desc: init_seq selects the output sequence for the RNG, you can pass any 64-bit value, although only the low 63 bits are significant.

    - name: seed
      type: function
      desc: Re-seed the random number generator by using entropy seed.
        Random number generator is always initialized by using entropy seed. You donâ€™t need to call this method unless you want to re-seed.
